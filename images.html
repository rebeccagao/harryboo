  Harry Styles is a <b> hot </b> man. His name sounds really <b> hot </b>. He sings really good and his new album is BOMB. He was in One Direction but I didn't really like it because it was sappy and too weird. He cut his hair short which is a lot hotter than his long, greasy, brown hair. It was disgusting. He was only attractive to me after he cut his hair and proved he could sing. Now he is a beautiful goddess.</p>
